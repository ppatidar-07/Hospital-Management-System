This Hospital Management System is developed using Python with Tkinter for the graphical user interface and MySQL for backend data storage.
The project is built and managed using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as the development environment. 
Key features of the system include the ability to add and manage prescription data, with full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality.
Users can easily update, delete, or clear patient and prescription information through a user-friendly interface. 
An exit button is also provided for safely closing the application. 
This system ensures efficient handling of hospital records, making it suitable for basic hospital or clinic management needs.
